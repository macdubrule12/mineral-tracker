# Email to AI Working Group - Critical Minerals Tracker

---

**TO:** AI Working Group (COO, Mary, team)
**FROM:** Jackson (on behalf of Mac)
**SUBJECT:** New Critical Minerals Intelligence Dashboard - Ready for Weekly Use
**DATE:** January 30, 2026

---

## Overview

I'm pleased to share that we've deployed a new **Critical Minerals News Tracker** dashboard that automates our minerals intelligence gathering and provides actionable policy recommendations for the team.

**Access the dashboard:** https://clearpath-minerals.streamlit.app

---

## The Problem We Solved

Our policy team was manually tracking critical minerals news across dozens of sources, spending hours each week identifying relevant stories, assessing their importance, and determining what actions to take. This process was:
- Time-consuming and inconsistent
- Difficult to share across the team
- Lacking structured follow-up on action items

---

## The Solution

An automated intelligence dashboard that:

### **1. Smart Relevance Scoring**
- Automatically categorizes stories as High/Medium/Low relevance to ClearPath's mission
- Filters by policy category (US Policy, Permitting, Domestic Supply, DOE Programs, etc.)
- Flags priority items requiring immediate team attention

### **2. Strategic Context & Recommendations**
Each high-priority story includes:
- **"Why It Matters"** - Multi-point analysis of policy significance, financial scale, and strategic implications
- **"ClearPath Strategic Angle"** - Specific action recommendations (e.g., "Brief Congressional staff," "Draft op-ed," "Track for case study")

### **3. Interactive Meeting Mode**
- Weekly digest prepared automatically before meetings
- Check off items as discussed
- Flag stories for follow-up with action notes
- Export meeting notes with assigned owners and timelines

### **4. Multi-Source Intelligence**
Aggregates from:
- Government sources (DOE, USGS, White House)
- Wire services (Reuters, Bloomberg)
- Trade press (Mining.com, Northern Miner)
- Policy analysis feeds
