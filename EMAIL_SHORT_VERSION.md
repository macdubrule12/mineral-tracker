**TO:** AI Working Group (COO, Mary, team)
**FROM:** Jackson
**SUBJECT:** Critical Minerals Intelligence Dashboard - Now Live
**DATE:** January 30, 2026

Team,

I'm excited to share our new **Critical Minerals News Tracker** dashboard, which automates our intelligence gathering and provides actionable policy recommendations.

**Access:** https://clearpath-minerals.streamlit.app

---

## What It Does

**Automated Intelligence:** Aggregates news from 12+ sources (DOE, Reuters, Bloomberg, trade press) and automatically scores relevance to ClearPath's mission

**Strategic Recommendations:** Every high-priority story includes context ("Why it matters") and specific action items ("Brief Congressional staff," "Draft op-ed," "Track for case study")

**Meeting Support:** Interactive weekly digest with task tracking, action assignment, and exportable meeting notes

---

## The Value

- **Time Savings:** Reduces weekly prep from 3 hours to 15 minutes
- **Better Decisions:** Consistent prioritization ensures nothing is missed
- **Improved Follow-Through:** Structured action tracking with owners and timelines
- **Team Alignment:** Shared view of priorities with strategic context

---

## Next Steps

We'll demonstrate the dashboard in tomorrow's weekly minerals meeting. Please try it out and share feedback on features or improvements.

**This is a significant step in leveraging AI/automation to support policy work—transforming raw news into actionable intelligence so our team can focus on strategy and execution.**
