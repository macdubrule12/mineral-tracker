## Tips for Great Meetings

### DO:
✅ Check off items as you discuss them (helps track progress)
✅ Use the action notes field - be specific!
✅ Export notes immediately after the meeting
✅ Review follow-up summary before ending meeting

### DON'T:
❌ Flag everything for follow-up (defeats the purpose - be selective!)
❌ Forget to add action notes (who/what/when)
❌ Leave the meeting without exporting notes
❌ Forget to reset tracking before next meeting

---

## Action Note Format

**Good action notes:**
- "Brief policy team on FEOC impact | Sarah | This week"
- "Draft op-ed on permitting delays | Comms team | Pitch by Friday"
- "Schedule call with DOE contact | GR team | Next month"

**Bad action notes:**
- "Follow up" (too vague)
- "Important" (not actionable)
- "TBD" (defeats the purpose)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While there are no special keyboard shortcuts, you can:
- **Tab** through checkboxes quickly
- **Click** checkboxes to toggle discussed status
- **Type** directly in notes fields

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My checkboxes aren't saving**

**Q: I accidentally flagged an item**
A: Click the "✓ Follow-up" button again OR use "Remove" in the Follow-up Summary

**Q: Can I edit notes after the meeting?**
A: Yes! As long as you haven't reset tracking or closed the browser, notes are editable

**Q: How do I clear everything for next week?**
A: Click "🔄 Reset Meeting Tracking" - this clears all checkboxes, flags, and notes
